#A Basic Starter for Leaflet and MapBox


##Purpose and Instructions

>The purpose of this project is just to be a very basic starter if you want an example of what a project with Leaflet and Mapbox looks like. I found the example on Leaflet website to be lacking on instructions for a beginner.

>To use, just download and replace both the Project Id and access token with your own from your Mapbox account.
